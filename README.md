This repo contains documentation and various notes (such as meeting minutes, in German) about my student research project about a qutebrowser plugin API at the HSR Hochschule f√ºr Technik Rapperswil.

It's public because there's no reason for it not to be, but please note that **no external contributions will be accepted**.

You might want to look at the [main repository](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) instead.
